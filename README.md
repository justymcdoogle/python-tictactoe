# A CLI python tictactoe game

Just wanted to test coding something myself without external tutorials or help :)

## Changes I want to make

- ~~I'd like to make sure the error messages for bad turns doesn't get cleared before the user sees it~~ DONE!
- ~~Print which player wins 'x/o'~~ DONE!
- Perhaps clarify better which space is which (1-9)
- Add a print line that shows who's turn it is currently
